yc sus winter 2020 begins

start a daily public dev log for all
okaq dev activities going forward
updated directly in terminal (vim)
markdown format for portability

currently evaluating:
AWS Sumerian
https://aws.amazon.com/sumerian/
Create web based 3D, VR, AR interactions

planning to develop a webgl content pipeline
analagous to the 2D bitmap sample and 
base64 json encode pipeline
that okaq uses for fast bitmap rendering
but the difference is we want "static renders"
complex procedurally generated 4D point clouds
and voxel based character and terrain renders
that can be done in a single frame
shown once on the screen
and interacted with for nano games

yc sus curriculum weekly videos
how to evaluate startup ideas
how to plan an mvp

we are already well on our way
i think what i would like to flesh out
is the vision for the Mobile LAN Unit
that goes into schools (or events at church, weddings)
and creates an e-sports style mini tourney
in a single subaru ascent
we can transport a mobile team
linux based server, network
and 2-4 4K rigs and monitors
the advantage here is all we need is
fullscreen chrome to run the games
and we can have user interactions with devices
as as crowd participation via mobile phone
"go to this url to vote who you think will win"
an offline "boook" and betting channel ;)

as far as evaluating startup ideas
this usually comes down to TAM and how to "capture value"
we won't concern ourselves now until we get initial distribution
and perhaps seed capital
the mvp is already in development

okaq progress is quite significant
even with our soft launch
and pilot school program

the main breakhrough is the fast design
bitmap decode and render for full HD
1 FPS animation
monochrome bitmaps
low entropy page size
less than 7 bits of data on the page
simple geometry, minimal text, intuitive play

the goal here
is to make it usable to 1B+ global players
and by distributing via gcloud / cloudflare
we can make a shared concurrent play world

current releases for play lab

Human Reaction Time
Human Memory Test
Global Psychism Assessment

today we are running tests
on animation logic

the browser can be limiting in this regard
there are the standard DOM timers
window setInterval and setTimeout
high performance timers in performance class
and requestAnimationFrame for 60 fps 

currently rendering the memory test
pre generated sequence of four quads
as an interval, with timeouts per frame
