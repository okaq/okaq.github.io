continue exploding the concept of   
Okaq Summer Olympics   

nano games from archery to waterpolo   
"turn based sports games"   
html5, deployed to google cloud / cloudflare   
rendered in performative style of atari 2600 action / arcade classics   
that teach basic concepts of "game state graph search" in modern AI   

we begin with a dive into atari tech   

my favorite cyberpunk video series of all time   
the "ultimate" talks from ccc.de

the craziest mos 6502 (valley forge, pa developed) platform ever   
and most active homebrew / demo scene in history   

Pong (1972) immediate hit   

initial video games inspo: analog classics   
checkers, chess, hangman, othello, pinball, casino   
(beach boardwalk skeeball would make an awesome webgl game)   
then, sports: basketball, boxing, football, soccer, decathalon   

ip licensed: et, muppets, indiana jones, peanuts, smurfs, 
spiderman, superman, star wars, chuck norris superkicks   
(at okaq we look to anime / manga inspo)   

originals the best: adventure, atlantis, demon attack, fathom,   
haunted house, hero, pitfall, solaris, yars revenge   
(steve jobs and woz wrote breakout)

atari coding in 1977 required special OS, assembler, debugger   
atari present day toolchain is sweet   
cross platform emulator, harmony carts   

homebrew community releases titles to this day, 100+ in release   
tools: DASM, CC65, Batari BASIC

instead of writing games from scratch   
hack ROMs, e.g. Pac-Man color and graphics   

begin emulator rom collection   
harvesting samples for texture synth   
tooling for level and asset editors, e.g. adventure, combat   
web based atari 2600 digital asset pipeline
