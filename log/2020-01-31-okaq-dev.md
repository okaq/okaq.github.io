quick review YC SUS Winter 2020 deals   
these are the credits and offers available   
to cohort participants provided by third parties, mostly saas, cloud   

we wont say too much about okaq strategy in this doc as it is public   
other than to describe the details and how it may apply   

firsty a bit of an announcement   
okaq has decided to partner with AWS for managed blockchain   
powering our online art auctions    
building on quantum ledger database in the cloud   
customer session in late feb   

now onto the deals   

algolia - search api, one of my fave enterprise saas offerings   
i have used their js library in the past, excellent product   

aws - amazon cloud, already a partner to okaq since 2006   
back when it was just s3 and ec2   
now looking at quantum ledger for blockchain art auctions   

atrium - startup legal services   
review okaq ip strategy, and okaq public license for all nano games   
am certain they will say "no" haha   

brex - credit card for startups   
raise 10K cash in bank, and get $75K rewards points   
obvious no brainer, but we need to be careful amassing debt   
if we can run lean and mean, only on allotted cloud credits   
and bootstrap crowd funding per nano game release   
okaq will be in a much better position   

clerky - startup legal paperwork   
fantastic for standard legal paperwork   
nda, employee agreements, incorp by-laws   
for anything more substantial including license   
we will need dedicated premium services    
i have ofetn remarked on the cost of prestige   
and how any market product solely differentiated on prestige premia   
will necessarily become commoditized digitally   

digital ocean - rock solid cloud host   
i believe okaq still has an account there   
credit, education, managed service   
you would be a fool not to take advantage   
research global network reach, particularly asia region   

f6s - canada only government startup loans   
okaq may enjoy a montreal presence   
details forthcoming as soon as we can schedule a trip   
perhaps as soon as may 2020   

front - popular slack alternative   
right now okaq uses slack / gitlab for remote team management   
and is looking to build on that platform   
but i would not mind evaluating free tier of front   

google cloud - managed cloud hosting services   
our primary partner, check if we can use new credit codes   
TPU Beta was very good for okaq AI research initiative   
it would be lovely to continue in that vein   
or even get into quantum computing pedagogy for K-12 (Project Sycamore)     

heroku - cloud paas    
okaq.com currently hosted on google cloud app engine (golang)    
but i could see offloading some redundancy or game stats onto heroku    
have prototyped web applications on heroku in the past   
and it is a dream to work with their platform   
instant deployment, global cdn distribution     

microsoft azure - startups program   
meeting scheduled soon in DC ;)   
partnership may include NASA Artemis human spaceflight   
via msft govt cloud (jedi contract)   
very exciting   

mongodb - json document database   
have been using since day one   
interested to check out their managed cloud hosted solutions   

retool - no-code interface builder   
looks interesting, at okaq largely in-house investment   
of html5 game dev tooling   
but we can explore the possibilities of where this fits in   

segment - analytics / optimization platform   
have heard great things and becoming a startup industry standard   
obviously okaq nano games and peer net will require a very high bar   
for how it handles in-game user stats as well as dynamic game state   
right now 100% developed in house, in memory hot cache using golang   
but this is a terrific deal, and could inform "what's hot" in our art auctions   

stripe - immediate payment processing api integrationfor okaq   
this will be a great partner, sorry to see them phase out bitcoin   
but square cash may be viable for that   

stripe atlas - incorp     
details forthcoming   

one other yc company i'd like to partner with   
as we produce short form sci fi video content and livestreams   
(besides youtube) is mux, cloud video host cdn   
reach out as well establish chan and studio
