YC SUS Winter 2020  
First group meeting tonite with new group  
Will head to "Wegman's Office" for better wifi  
Also have user interviews with parents / educators  
Interest level in AI pedagogy for K-12 is decent  

okaq central dogma  
is the "game school" concept  
we teach "video game art"  
or a formal class on "zero budget game dev"  
through a physical school in which classes are broadcast online  

but we teach a new type of game  
nano games, native to the cloud  
with a global scale peer net of concurrent players  
design itself is mediated by AI  
what I mean by that is not only the digital  
and procedural content generation pipelines  
using AI to synthesize textures  
but the actual games themselves  
seek interesting AI solutions  

like ai.generals.io  
i would like to to invite bot play and competition eventually
tron light cycles can be used to learn global expectimax, etc  

online competitions  
aicrowd.com  
summer camps  
ai-4-all.org

working on animation logic for  
okaq human memory test nano game  
the abstraction necessary is to create  
a timeline, and then split it into  
a collection of deterministic sub timelines  
that will finish in the global duration  

each timeline itself consists of  
a start, end and duration  
this can be expressed relative to a global clock  
but more commonly it will be triggered upon an event  
such as user input or game state change  

except for the D3 js timeline class  
there is no working logic for dom timeline events handling  
apart from the standard library  
window.settimeout  
window.setinterval  
window.requestanimationframe  
and using the high performance timer
window.performance.now()  

so i will be sure to roll my own  
and there is a lot to intelligently keep track of within the manager  
id's for clearing the loop frame trigger  
the conditional when a sub tock count is elapsed  
render perfromance to ensure we render within the 1fps frame
