How To Talk To Users  
How To Launch  

I'd also like to review the AMAs  
It's unfortunate that we have not been able to schedule  
But our AWS Sumerian chat took precedence  

On the whole our webgl / vr / ar strategy  
Will not be seen on the main okaq nano game site  
Until we deploy 2D at web scale  
For now webgl is reserved for the content pipeline  
Static renders and sprites to bitmap texture synth  

okaq memory test nano game  

breaking frame methods up  
decide what to update, render in composable manner  

setting up stripe api integration  
atlas is still a probability  
delaware c corp and equity issue  
square cash app crowd funding  
i would love to do this 100% in btc denominated funding  
i see okaq nano game fostering crypto transactions  

ok just watched eric migicovsky (pebble) lecture  
how to conduct user interviews  
and he made a really great point  
"just show up"  

i have been doing this already and i can attest to how open  
potential users can be if you are offering a solution  
that can actually work!  

it may seem strange for a middle age solo founder  
to want to talk to parents / educators about AI  
but people are actually very invested  
they understand the problem explicitly  
AI is a critical skill in the 21st century  
they may see MIT PhDs getting funded  
but they dont realize the curriculum available to them  
and the importance of starting early on the fundamentals  

of course it goes without saying  
it helps having a winning personality  
and a talent with interacting with kids  

now kat manalac on launch (again and again)  
she says during Q & A "no extravagant parties"  
which is basically the okaq launch strategy in a nutshell  
more on this in detail, but events will be a big revenue driver for okaq  
i just love to party  

okaq human play lab launches  
before initial game release  
this allows me to gain critical data on  
human reaction time  
human memory test  
global psychism assessment  
browser rendering and performance  
browser cpabilities like screen resolution and webgl  
network latency and global distribution  

collected data in turn informs the game design  

set up art auction sales and  
okaq bitstarter crowd fund campaign  
even before loud launch  
with silent mission statement of purpose
