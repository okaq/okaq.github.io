Consciousness  

This constitutes the New Curriculum  
For AI pedagogy targeting the K-12 audience  

We start with simple nano games  
Illustrating the basics of   
Computational Probability and Inference  
Via exciting and enlightening gameplay  

A note on "Consciousness"  
When did we as Homo Sapiens  
Become aware of our condition, our mortality  

In the past, efforts were made in machine intelligence  
To discursively and exhaustively map  
Relations in the human percieved world  

But what about starting with a machine  
That understood its own silicon based physics  
The goal is a machine that designs better machines  
which may be the only "artificial consciousness" achievable

AWS video chat, cloud databases for video games   

Aurora, large scale relational, data schema, fast read, sql-compatible  
for now i prefer running sqlite3 instances managed myself   
single thread, single process, serverless magic, up to 500 TB per instance  

sql use cases: matchmaker ratings, number played, win loss ratio   
player data, static game data, inventory, digital goods exchange, leaderboards   
relational queries faster on "non-sparse" data   

AWS nosql database, highly specific queries, json document data   
DynamoDB, key value store mapped to "blobs" on disk, low latency, scalable   
player/item, game/state are examples of key value schema   
enchantments and upgrades are a common use case for extensible key value stores   
npc, quest data, peer net state, all examples of dynamic schema   
we can begin how this makes of games designed   
with procedural content generation mediated by deep reinforcement learning ;)   

AWS in memory cache, no persistance, but fast sort and range queries   
aws will get back to us about cdn distribution for cache in asia regions   
fully managed solution AWS ElastiCache, infinite scalability   

recommendation for large scale data blobs and binary data   
aws document database DocumentDB managed offering   
very large blob sizes, global distribution   
great for on-demand assets and digital goods   

the point was raised   
much cloud game data state and processing   
is offload from client to server   
for the purpose of "cheat busting"   
if stored in memory on the client, it may be easy to access and find flaws   

okaq vision is cheats are obviated in very hard turn based strategy games   
we encourage human machine interaction   

AWS managed distributed ledger database   
transaction time and user stamps, cryptographically signed, immutable   
AWS Quantum Ledger Database managed hosting   
for okaq auctions, this may be essential partnership   
verifiable transaction logs   
central authority ownership   
fine grained logging for each and every application data change and event   
data delta history is provably immutable   
for auctions, performance and transaction add speed may not be an issue   
use cases: currency trades, digital goods exchange, auction house   
experimental: game play rules sets   

AWS Graph Database    
SPOG (Subject, Predicate, Object, Graph)   
Amazon Neptune fully managed, high availability      
graph models: w3c rdf, property graph   
languages: amazon tinker pop gremlin, sparql   
use case: game economics, item flow, fraud detection,    
recommendatin engines, npc relations, goal planning   
this is the beating heart of game ai ;)   

AWS API Gateway, rate limiting, logging, auth, bandwidth throttling   

single large vm instance of mysql in cloud cost ~$2000 / month   

crypto space commanders blockchain io game ;)

excellent video chat, and looks like go for AWS Quantum Ledger   
across all auction art sales for okaq funding
