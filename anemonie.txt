Codename: Anemone (sea anemone, isoginchaku)

An A.I. agent that can "use" the world wide web
as effectively as humans.

Let's define the term "use the web":
In the course of conducting research
or transacting via e-commerce systems,
we may have 20 browser tabs open, navigate
(somewhat) efortlessly through many
of different UI paradigms 
(retro, minimal, responsive, dynamic, etc).
In fact each web app is different.
Each app on divergant devices may also
behave differently due to performance issues.
What should be the relatively simple task of 
researching a grade school level paper on coral reefs


The goals are 
democratize A.I.
foster A.I. pedagogy
product: virtual personal assistant
that understands human language queries
and can execute them, returning condensed
results as well as a human
product: a proxy usability layer

Funds for
solving the problem
strategy is to break into sub-problems and sample the web!
start with 100 most useful sites and scale
branding, marketing, go-to-market strategy

NYC A.I. Hub
pivotal in community
