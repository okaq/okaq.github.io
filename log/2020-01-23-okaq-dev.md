YC SUS Winter 2020  
First group meeting tonite with new group  
Will head to "Wegman's Office" for better wifi  
Also have user interviews with parents / educators  
Interest level in AI pedagogy for K-12 is decent  

okaq central dogma  
is the "game school" concept  
we teach "video game art"  
or a formal class on "zero budget game dev"  
through a physical school in which classes are broadcast online  

but we teach a new type of game  
nano games, native to the cloud  
with a global scale peer net of concurrent players  
design itself is mediated by AI  
what I mean by that is not only the digital  
and procedural content generation pipelines  
using AI to synthesize textures  
but the actual games themselves  
seek interesting AI solutions  

like ai.generals.io  
i would like to to invite bot play and competition eventually
tron light cycles can be used to learn global expectimax, etc
