"its all happening" -penny lane   

brief note on the competition   
that makes light of "coding for kids"   
usually in the form of simple games   
or lego mindstorms type declarative, imperative, visual envs   
no one is really teaching AI directly to everyone   
it is usually STEM focus, with an "inclusivity" agenda   

roblox, of course - sophisticated devenv, global ip (fast furious)   

tinkercad - ipad friendly, 3D intro, blocks env   

lightbot - 3D algorithmic puzzle games   

osmo - genius starter kit, loads of fun peripherals, playful design yet chic   

sphero - steam bots

scratch - media lab, visual env, classic roots in logo, turtle graphics   

tynker - blocks community, sprite animations

major trend is use of iPad, Kindle   
i still like the okaq mobile LAN vision   
dedicated head to head play in the arena   
not every kid needs to bath in solitude alone in the world with just a screen   
4K chrome is all we need baby   
like the scene in never say never again   
james bond vs max largo   
domination - the eternal battle   
but instead of pain, its AI acumen   

    ---== Generators ==---    

okaq nano game basis   
is "code art"   

digital content procedurally generated from algorithms   
simple geometric instructions in the conceptual art vein (sol lewitt)   
as well as more involved ai / ml trained agents   
deep dream / style gan / tensorlow / magenta   

introduced a bitmap sampler   
1024-bit monochrome, 32 x 32 pixel standard       
encoded to base64 json, fast browser decode and render   
idea is to serve a page in 100 ms anywhere in the world   
and render logical screens and bitmap elements in 100 ms   
to create a web based nano game that starts in one second   
and itself plays at one frame per second (1 fps) animation speed

okaq golf man and dragon logos   

note on okaq logo   
it can be anything, as long as it is distributable via the algorithmic instructions   
text "okaq" bitmap chars, as mask for more complex plasma back grounds for example   

design of okaq nano games    
we start with the "game mechanic"   
the basic quantum of play available to the player as human input   
this is usually abstracted so as to make simple    
the algoritm needed to teach the machine to play   

the code begins with "generators"   
a simple exmaple is the "text list"   
bitmap font string of words conveying data or instructions to the player   
we keep the amount of text to a minimum to    
foment a global audience (perhaps non english speaking)   

the output of the generators is a canvas object list   
the canvas list is attached to a logical "screen" via DOM   
state is kept in data set variables   
user interaction event handlers ("click")    
are attached and removed according to the game rules   
animation timers, render functions, timelines all composed   

the central store is the db class   
this is a key value table   
that holds all game config, layout, data, rules, state and player score
