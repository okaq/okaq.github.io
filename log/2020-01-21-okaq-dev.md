current interest  
finn brunton, nyu  
unknow history of digital cash  
prime reading material for upcoming  
simons institute blockchain series  
and our own experiements  
in okaq per game equity issueance  

our findings varying animation frame intervals  
was quite substantial  
memory games where the player repeats  
a given pre-generated sequence  
are absolutely dependent upon playback framerate  

as noted previously  
this sort of insight  
is the essence of the mission  
of okaq Human Play Lab  
"humanity deserves better games"  

in summary, the 1fps animation  
we sought to pioneer with okaq nano games  
may be too quick for ordinary humans  
for the initial release of  
okaq Human Memory Test  
we drop it down to 2500ms per frame  
with half interval black / white render  

continue development of user interaction  
and create the third "frame" screen today  

dev log hosted at github pages  
https://okaq.github.io/log

just a directory listing for now  
uses github contents api  
to async fetch json file list  
thanks to stackoverflow user TimE ;)  

markdown formatting options  
still a work in progress  
for now use double inline return  
or two spaces at end of each line  \s\s
