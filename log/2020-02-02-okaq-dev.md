"its all happening" -penny lane   

brief note on the competition   
that makes light of "coding for kids"   
usually in the form of simple games   
or lego mindstorms type declarative, imperative, visual envs   
no one is really teaching AI directly to everyone   
it is usually STEM focus, with an "inclusivity" agenda   

roblox, of course - sophisticated devenv, global ip (fast furious)   

tinkercad - ipad friendly, 3D intro, blocks env   

lightbot - 3D algorithmic puzzle games   

osmo - genius starter kit, loads of fun peripherals, playful design yet chic   

sphero - steam bots

scratch - media lab, visual env, classic roots in logo, turtle graphics   

tynker - blocks community, sprite animations

major trend is use of iPad, Kindle   
i still like the okaq mobile LAN vision   
dedicated head to head play in the arena   
not every kid needs to bath in solitude alone in the world with just a screen   
4K chrome is all we need baby   
like the scene in never say never again   
james bond vs max largo   
domination - the eternal battle   
but instead of pain, its AI acumen
