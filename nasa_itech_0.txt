What is Humanity's Great Purpose in Space?

"The people of the United States spend
exactly as much money on booze alone
as on the space program" -Asimov

We need more than just each other

We need to know we are not alone

It all begins quite humbly

With next generation space telescopes

Kicking off a New Golden Age of Astronomy

Aided in the quest for exoplanet reseach

In detection and characterization of habitable zones

By enormous capabilities in machine intelligence

As the signitures of astrobiological preponderence

Begin to accumulate

Humanity re-news its focus on the search

For extra-terrestrial life

The challenges of exploration are Promethean

And requires a revolution in design thinking

Aided by machine intelligence

Working in harmony with that of Humans

A preliminary and cursive enumeration:

Next-gen ground based propulsion systems

Based on mag-lev technology

That can send vessels into orbit

Without combustion of non-renewable fossil fuels

Shielding of space colony architectures

From the immense solar weather and radiation

That would have devestating effects upon exposure

Mitigating the long term effects of reduced gravity

On human physiology genetically adapted to

The One G Environment of Earth

The complex orbital mechanics of using 

Gravity itself to slingshot deep space probes

Communication systems that can reliably multiplex

Broadband deep space communications and imaging

And that is not even scratching the surface

Of the psychic implications of First Contact

With an alien intelligence that may be vastly

Superior to our own or exist in 

Higher dimensions of space and time

The one common denominator of all these challenges

Is the demand for AI

There are those that believe we are 

Proverbially speaking, digging our own graves

And the development of Strong AI portends

And existential risk to humanity we cannot survive

There are those who believe technology has outstripped

Our capacity to deal with it politically, justly

And that the tool itself is too powerful for

Our imaginations to concieve of what to do with it

There are those who believe its successes are coincidental

That neural nets and the backprop algorithm

Are simply de-noising auto-encoders

And any progress has been purely an affect of increases

In computing power at cloud scale

And that AI Winter 2.0 is upon us

And then there remain the realists

Who see the current challenges facing 

The 10 Billion humans soon to inhabit our planet

And the potential utopia we can create

And seek to develop machine intelligence capable

Of realizing our goals
