YC SUS Winter 2020  
First group meeting tonite with new group  
Will head to "Wegman's Office" for better wifi  
Also have user interviews with parents / educators  
Interest level in AI pedagogy for K-12 is decent  

okaq central dogma  
is the "game school" concept  
we teach "video game art"  
or a formal class on "zero budget game dev"  
through a physical school in which classes are broadcast online  

but we teach a new type of game  
nano games, native to the cloud  
with a global scale peer net of concurrent players  
design itself is mediated by AI  
what I mean by that is not only the digital  
and procedural content generation pipelines  
using AI to synthesize textures  
but the actual games themselves  
seek interesting AI solutions  

like ai.generals.io  
i would like to to invite bot play and competition eventually
tron light cycles can be used to learn global expectimax, etc  

online competitions  
aicrowd.com  
summer camps  
ai-4-all.org  
social good

working on animation logic for  
okaq human memory test nano game  
the abstraction necessary is to create  
a timeline, and then split it into  
a collection of deterministic sub timelines  
that will finish in the global duration  

each timeline itself consists of  
a start, end and duration  
this can be expressed relative to a global clock  
but more commonly it will be triggered upon an event  
such as user input or game state change  

except for the D3 js timeline class  
there is no working logic for dom timeline events handling  
apart from the standard library  
window.settimeout  
window.setinterval  
window.requestanimationframe  
and using the high performance timer
window.performance.now()  

so i will be sure to roll my own  
and there is a lot to intelligently keep track of within the manager  
id's for clearing the loop frame trigger  
the conditional when a sub tock count is elapsed  
render perfromance to ensure we render within the 1fps frame

interesting that nantucket whaling adventures were the first 10x bets in the new world  
as okaq starts to raise funds  
i'd like to focus first on mobile LAN endeavors  
events will be the primary revenue stream  

build the landing site with human play lab  
and have a crowd fund link and bitcoin address ready to accept transactions  

YC SUS email from eric migicovsky  
invite to "pitch a partner" on twitter  
as i deleted the twitter.com/okaq account  
roughly the day that miley cyrus joined  
i don't think that is the medium for okaq  
instead i'd like to work on the youtube chan  
and develop the pitch video that will be submitted to YC Summer 2020  

the concept is a re=working of the classic mtv music video  
talking heads  -  once in a lifetime  
"you may ask yourself, how did i get here"  

we are looking forward obviously  
to the coming martian technocracy  

the okaq "pitch" is pretty simple  
i teach AI to kids using video games  
nano games built in html5, webgl, webrtc  
and deployed to google cloud / cloudflare  
the video games are the "simulated learning environment"  
and instruct students in AI "primitives"  
such as a\* search, expectimax, constraint satisfaction,  
computational inference and goal oriented action planning  
with the eventual goal of a gaining an intuitive understanding  
of state of the art deep reinforecement learning techniques    
as of today no such curriculum exists at the K-12 level  
most online ai challenges and hackathons exist at the grad student level  
i will translate these lessons to the medium of video game art  
specifically targeting the unique attention spans of the K-12 audience  
a note on game design  
this is not "education software"  
i envision it as a proper game studio and game school  
just as popular and oriented to hit-making as epic or valve  
and the gamedev process itself will be mediated and enhanced  
by our research into AI procedural content generation  
as well as finding of the okaq human play lab
