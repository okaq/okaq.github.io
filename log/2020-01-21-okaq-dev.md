current interest  
finn brunton, nyu  
unknow history of digital cash  
prime reading material for upcoming  
simons institute blockchain series  
and our own experiements  
in okaq per game equity issueance  

our findings varying animation frame intervals  
was quite substantial  
memory games where the player repeats  
a given pre-generated sequence  
are absolutely dependent upon playback framerate  

as noted previously  
this sort of insight  
is the essence of the mission  
of okaq Human Play Lab  
"humanity deserves better games"  

in summary, the 1fps animation  
we sought to pioneer with okaq nano games  
may be too quick for ordinary humans  
for the initial release of  
okaq Human Memory Test  
we drop it down to 2500ms per frame  
with half interval black / white render  

continue development of user interaction  
and create the third "frame" screen today  

dev log hosted at github pages  
https://okaq.github.io/log  
included index.html  
just a directory listing for now  
uses github contents api  
to async fetch json file list  
thanks to stackoverflow user TimE ;)  

markdown formatting options  
still a work in progress  
for now use double inline return  
or two spaces at end of each line  \s\s

YC SUS W20  
Landing page game  
where entrants post url  
and contestants need to guess what your startup does  
one interesting area i would like to get into   
is direct digital democracy   
this can look like voting on your mobile   
or actual allocation of funds via crowd consensus  
as well as tracking grant progress and research results   
there need to be better metrics  
in return on research expenditures   

my fave was come & gone
a "post-sex cleanup sponge"
on point, very clear
"no man would think of this"

Methods to attach and detach event handlers
to a scene canvas object list
we need to parametrize the handler itself
this should come naturally from config
but game state can alter which handler gets attached

game flow for memory test sequence screen
generate the sequence, 999 items
render four black quads
detach the handlers, if attached on init
play sequence up to current tick
attach handlers for user input
game state list for player sequence
upon each click event, obtain id from dataset.x
push onto list
compare list to generated sequence
if match, jump to next frame
else loss condition met
go to win screen and render text list score
global stats, leader board on separate text list
display for ten seconds, then return to title screen

"time out your spec" -seibel
