YC SUS Winter 2020 week 4 update   
must complete all activities today   
 
lite posting as dc trip itinerary   
microsoft govt cloud (jedi) conf   

office hours with eric and kat   
"dont wait, its not sacred, dont throw a party"   

all rules okaq will break with its planned launch ;)     
okaq laptop orch   
okaq summer olympics   

a note on xhr / binary xhr data transport   
okaq game server sync   
peer net conns broker   
global play stats   
all require data transport   

advance dev of websockets in golang   
but for now http rest api suffices   

to cut overhead, okaq employs simple hacks   
use map[string]string as the primary data type   
on the server side golang hot in-memory cache   

map[string]string is trivial to marshal / serialize   

use window.fetch async / await promises   

json request / response data types   
binary blobs for raw images larger than 15kB   
inline data-url base64 encoded suffices for small images   
but adds a bit of decoding overhead   
plain text is fine for updates   

the initial okaq nano game round-trip ping-pong "handshake"   
looks some thing like this (hit it now)   

"eBPF is the New Linux"   
this will get very low level, eventually   
but for v1, no need to prematurely optimize   

client player id (pid) is generated in browser   
data format "rng:time" all strings   
send to server in post request body as json   

server side player id (sid) is generated via golang   
concatentate with pid to form player key (kid)   
data format "browser_rng:browser_time::server_rng:server_time"   

another immutable: "dont change your logo"    
okaq changes its identity every day
