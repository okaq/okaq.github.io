yc sus winter 2020 begins

start a daily public dev log for all
okaq dev activities going forward
updated directly in terminal (vim)
markdown format for portability

currently evaluating:
AWS Sumerian
https://aws.amazon.com/sumerian/
Create web based 3D, VR, AR interactions

planning to develop a webgl content pipeline
analagous to the 2D bitmap sample and 
base64 json encode pipeline
that okaq uses for fast bitmap rendering
but the difference is we want "static renders"
complex procedurally generated 4D point clouds
and voxel based character and terrain renders
that can be done in a single frame
shown once on the screen
and interacted with for nano games

how to evaluate startup ideas
how to plan an mvp

we are already well on our way
i think what i would like to flesh out
is the vision for the Mobile LAN Unit
that goes into schools (or events at church, weddings)
and creates an e-sports style mini tourney
in a single subaru ascent
we can transport a mobile team
linux based server, network
and 2-4 4K rigs and monitors
the advantage here is all we need is
fullscreen chrome to run the games
and we can have user interactions with devices
as as crowd participation via mobile phone
"go to this url to vote who you think will win"
an offline "boook" and betting channel ;)

as far as evaluating startup ideas
this usually comes down to TAM and how to "capture value"
we won't concern ourselves now until we get initial distribution
and perhaps seed capital
the mvp is already in development

okaq progress is quite significant
even with our soft launch
and pilot school program

the main breakhrough is the fast design
bitmap decode and render for full HD
1 FPS animation
monochrome bitmaps
low entropy page size
less than 7 bits of data on the page
simple geometry, minimal text, intuitive play

the goal here
is to make it usable to 1B+ global players
and by distributing via gcloud / cloudflare
we can make a shared concurrent play world

current releases for play lab

Human Reaction Time
Human Memory Test
Global Psychism Assessment

today we are running tests
on animation logic

the browser can be limiting in this regard
there are the standard DOM timers
window setInterval and setTimeout
high performance timers in performance class
and requestAnimationFrame for 60 fps 

currently rendering the memory test
pre generated sequence of four quads
as an interval, with timeouts per frame
https://github.com/okaq/giri/lito/baku.html

MEMORY TEST SEQUENCE

in okaq nano game 
minimal style
the human memory test cycle
can be done in three (3) logical screens
title / swan - pause 5 seconds
sequence and play - at 1 fps
final score - stats - pause 4 seconds

to playback the sequence
four quads (256x256px) 
are rendered in the dead center
of the full hd 1920x1080px screen

a pre-generated sequence
of index values (0-3) is generated
using standard js math.random flips

we tested playback at a variety of 
interval frame timings

we can safely assume
due to the simple geometry of the quads
that the render step is negligible
in terms of performance hit
on order of ~1ms

and our findings are very interesting!
this goes to the root of the endeavors
with the creation of okaq human play lab
"humanity deserves better video games"

1 fps
which constitutes the modus operandi
the hallmark of okaq nano games
designed to be playable on standard web browsers
at web scale globally

testing the human memory test playback at intervals
between 1000/500 ms and 2500/1250 ms blink times
in other words, at each 1000 ms interval
the index quad in sequence is rendered as
white for 500 ms, and black as the second half 500 ms

it was found that 1fps may be too fast for human cognition
we slow it down for this release to 2500ms intervals

but it would be expedient to do a "hacker elite" version

we generate two sequences, alpha and beta

player must memorize both simultaneously

after the beta sequence plays
with additional iteration added to the end
the player must input the alpha
and so on until a single mistake!
