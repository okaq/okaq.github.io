Consciousness  

This constitutes the New Curriculum  
For AI pedagogy targeting the K-12 audience

A note on "Consciousness"  
When did we as Homo Sapiens  
Become aware of our condition, our mortality  

In the past, efforts were made in machine intelligence  
To discursively and exhaustively map  
Relations in the human percieved world  

But what about starting with a machine  
That understood its own silicon based physics  
The goal is a machine that designs better machines  
which may be the only "artificial consciousness" achievable
