â€œArtificial intelligence is that activity  
devoted to making machines intelligent,  
and intelligence is that quality that enables  
an entity to function appropriately  
and with foresight in its environment"  
-Norvig and Russell textbook definiton  

Can be simplified to:  
An agent that extracts the *optimal*  
value from its environment  

Note we say *optimal*  
and not *maximum*  
it must be beneficial to all  
and not merely vacuum up all  
resources to exhaustion

okaq nano games for human play lab  
animation logic and game play sequence  
human memory test  

tick tock frame loop  
maintain two counters: global & local  
the global counter is the game "level"  
the local counter the sequence up to index  

animation timeline hierachies  
mapped to layers of callbacks  
is probably what we want to avoid  
but for now we have three nested functions  
setting global tick to zero and starting the game  
setting the local tock to zero and starting the sequence
frame update to render, create blink timeout, win condition
