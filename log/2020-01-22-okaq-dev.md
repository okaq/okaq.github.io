YC SUS Winter 2020  
Progress Report  
WTL still about 2-3 weeks  
Until Okaq Human Play Lab  
With three nano games  
Human Reaction Time  
Human Memory Test  
Global Psychism Assessment  

It was an interesting exercise to  
play the "guess my startup" game  
considering the okaq landing "swan" page  
will just be the okaq golf man logo rendered in <100ms ;)  

incremental progress on human memory test prototype  
the main breakthrough is a new minimalist style  

attach and detach methods for canvas list objects added  
this will fire once per frame between playback  
and user input of sequence events
