YC SUS Winter 2020  
Progress Report  
WTL still about 2-3 weeks  
Until Okaq Human Play Lab  
With three nano games  
Human Reaction Time  
Human Memory Test  
Global Psychism Assessment  

It was an interesting exercise to  
play the "guess my startup" game  
considering the okaq landing "swan" page  
will just be the okaq golf man logo rendered in <100ms ;)  

incremental progress on human memory test prototype  
the main breakthrough is a new minimalist style  

attach and detach methods for canvas list objects added  
this will fire once per frame between playback  
and user input of sequence events  

psyched to start the psychism test  
this is really a network global performance measure  
and will help in judging peer net capabilities  
to inform concurrent cloud game design  

The Edge of Emulation (SNES)  
https://byuu.org/articles/edge-of-emulation  
Nintendo is a big "get" for okaq   
partnership-wise and other-wise  
we mine rom data for texture synth patches  
and resurrect ancient game play primitives  
but also in the nand to tetris sense  
AI pedagogy will employ nintendo ip at root  
and we work to license or open as much as possible  
this may require a tokyo office  

the next evolution of software programming K-12  
will be voice based  
in the same way a child can ask  
"Hey Google, what's the weather like on Mars today"?  
they should be able to compose variables and operate upon them  
using only human interpretable natural language
