excellent group meet last nite  
b & n promendae office worked well for thurs 8pm wifi  
interest in okaq "games that teach ai"  
but its the cloud nano game capabilities  
no landing page, right into the game in one second  
120ms net latency to 1B+ global web players  
bitmap render in less than 10ms  
page load size under 1MB  
demonstartions of ai based game play  
content that is itself fun and not education software focused  

submit okaq pitch message  
as well as concerns about crowdraise / bootstrap  
the vision here is revenue key driver: events  
okaq mobile lan party unit  
bare bones its just a subaru, 4K monitors, chromeOS thin clients, server, wifi router  
we go into schools, weddings and set up an e-sports style tourney  
but instead of action based fps shooters  
its games that test mental agility  
player vs ai  
ai + player peer net
